# Mental Health Simulation (DSA-Based Project)

## Project Title:
Mental Health Simulation

## Description:
This project is a console-based simulation system that allows users to manage and track their mental health through various moods and notes. It uses key Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to implement real-world features such as undoing mood entries, viewing mood history, and analyzing mood trends.

## Features:
- User Signup and Login using File Handling
- Mood Entry with Mood Level and Notes
- Undo Last Mood Entry using Stack
- Mood History stored in a Singly Linked List
- Mood Score Analysis using Binary Search Tree (BST)
- User Session Management

## Data Structures Used:
| Feature                | DSA Used              |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Undo Last Mood         | Stack (LIFO)          |
| History of Moods       | Singly Linked List    |
| Mood Score Analysis    | Binary Search Tree    |
| User Data Storage      | File I/O              |

## Technologies:
- C++ (Console-Based)
- File Handling
- OOP Concepts

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/PavankumarU/Mental-Health-Simulation-DSA
   ```
2. Navigate to the folder:
   ```
   cd Mental-Health-Simulation-DSA
   ```
3. Compile and run:
   ```
   g++ main.cpp -o mental_health
   ./mental_health
   ```
